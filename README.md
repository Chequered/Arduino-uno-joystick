##Connect your Arduino to Unity.

Before continuing with this tutorial make sure you have the following at your disposal:

- Arduino Uno with placement board.
- Unity3D
- Arduino program (Codebender or the program found on Arduino’s website)
- Miscellaneous wires. (Included with an Arduino)
- Two resistors (Included with an Arduino)
- 2-way Axis Joystick
- USB Cable (Included with an Arduino)
- Computer

Do you have these things? Yes. Then continue.

**Step 1.** Connect the 2-way Axis Joystick to the Arduino with the wires and resistors. Here’s an image for reference: http://learn.parallax.com/sites/default/files/content/kickstart/images/Joystick-6.png

**Step 2.** Open the Arduino program and copy-paste the code from the joystick_sketch.ino file to your Arduino editor of choice.

**Step 3.** Upload the script to your Arduino.

Make sure your Arduino is connected at this point.

**Step 4.** Start Unity3D, download the project from Github and open it in Unity.

**Step 5.** Drag and drop the SerialRotation.cs script to a new GameObject.

**Step 6.** Press play and watch the magic happen.

You can read the comments in the scripts and try to understand the logic behind it.

Now you can expand on this project and make a small game using the Arduino and joystick.
